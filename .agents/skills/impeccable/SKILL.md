# Impeccable for KNJSC

Project adaptation: use the existing visual guidance without an automatic engine.
Shared rules are in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).
Design context is in [DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md),
[design.json](../../design-state/design.json), and `.agents/design-state/surfaces/`.
The user requires project skill/context files to stay under `.agents`.

## Workflow

1. Identify the requested surface and the current visual/interaction behavior.
2. Read the relevant design context and only one matching reference below.
3. Preserve business behavior and the existing design unless a redesign is authorized.
4. Before an authorized UI edit, read [craft floor](reference/craft-floor.md).
5. Implement within scope; use browser capabilities actually available in this client.
6. Inspect the result in a bounded pass; fix observed issues and confirm the outcome.
7. Report checks and missing tools honestly. Do not repeat visual polishing indefinitely.

## Selective references

- New surface: [new work](reference/new-work.md).
- Operational CRM UI: [operate](reference/operate.md).
- UX planning: [shape](reference/shape.md).
- Design review: [critique](reference/critique.md).
- Accessibility and technical review: [audit](reference/audit.md).
- Small finishing work: [polish](reference/polish.md).

Read only the sections relevant to the task. References are upstream material;
project rules and this entrypoint govern any incompatible engine instructions.

## Runtime boundary

Do not automatically run Impeccable context, engine commands, hooks, or subagents.
The original engine workflow is retained at [engine workflow](reference/engine-workflow.md)
for maintenance only; it may create a root `.impeccable` directory.
Do not read it for routine UI work or recreate that directory.
Use `.agents/design-state` for project design context and local review artifacts.
The bundled engine is not verified to support this relocated state; do not pretend
that moving files configures the binary. Engine integration requires a separate,
explicitly requested task. Manual guidance and existing browser tools remain usable.
Do not assume Claude-specific agents or tools exist in Codex.
